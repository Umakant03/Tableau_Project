# Developer Survey Analysis

#  About Project

This project is analysis about finding the trending and upcomming technology using Stack Overflow2019 dataset.

Once i collected enough data, i  will begin analyzing the data and identify insights and 
trends that may include the following

Q1.What are the top programming languages in demand?

Q2.What are the top database skills in demand?

Q3.What are the popular platform developer workwith?

Q4.What are the Popular Framework developer workwith?

Tools:Pandas,Seaborn,Matplotlib,Tableau.
 
## Part1:Data Collection

In this project i am using 2019Stack Overflow Normalised dataset for analysis.
Dataset is not in proper format and it contain NULL values and missing values.

## Part2:Data Wrangling

In this part i am  focusing on the cleaning of our dataset with various techniques.

Store the collected data in Panda DataFrame and perform data wrangling.

Identify 154 duplicate using Pandas duplicated() method and drop the duplicate rows.

Determine the missing values in dataset using Pandas isnull() method and replace missing values with mean,median and mode of variable.

Normalize the Income column by converting developer income into Yearly Income.

Part3:Exploratory Data Analysis
In this part, begin working with the cleaned dataset from the previous part.
 analyze the dataset to find the distribution of data,remove presence of outliers and the correlation between different columns

Part4:
creating  visualizations using the developer survey data. 
The visualizations should highlight distribution of data, relationships between data, composition of data and comparison of data.
